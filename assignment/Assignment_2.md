### JavaScript Assignment: Understanding Variables

#### Objective:
To understand and practice working with variables in JavaScript, including declaring, assigning, and manipulating them.

#### Instructions:
Create a JavaScript file named `variablesAssignment.js` and complete each task below. Test each step by logging results to the console.

---

### Tasks:

#### Step 1: Declare Variables
1. **Declare three variables**: `name`, `age`, and `isStudent`.
   - `name` should store your name as a **string**.
   - `age` should store your age as a **number**.
   - `isStudent` should store whether you are a student as a **boolean**.

2. **Log each variable** to the console, stating its type. For example:
   ```javascript
   console.log("Name:", name, "| Type:", typeof name);
   ```

#### Step 2: Assign New Values
1. **Change the values** of each variable:
   - Set `name` to a different name.
   - Set `age` to a new number (either older or younger).
   - Toggle the value of `isStudent` (if true, change to false; if false, change to true).

2. Log the updated values and types to the console.

#### Step 3: Math Operations
1. **Create two number variables**: `num1` and `num2` with values of your choice.
2. Perform the following operations and log each result:
   - Add `num1` and `num2`
   - Subtract `num2` from `num1`
   - Multiply `num1` by `num2`
   - Divide `num1` by `num2`
   - Find the remainder when `num1` is divided by `num2` (use the modulo operator `%`)

#### Step 4: String Concatenation
1. Create a new variable called `greeting`.
   - Set it to a sentence using the `name` and `age` variables from Step 2. 
   - For example: `"Hello, my name is [name] and I am [age] years old."`

2. Log the `greeting` variable to the console.

#### Step 5: Use `const` and `let`
1. **Re-declare** the `name` variable using `const`, and try changing its value. (Observe any errors and note them in a comment.)
2. Declare a variable using `let` to represent your favorite color and set it to a color of your choice. Change its value later in the script.

#### Step 6: Comment Your Code
Add comments throughout the code explaining what each part does. This will help you understand your code and help others reading it.

### Sample Output
```javascript
Name: John | Type: string
Age: 25 | Type: number
Is Student: true | Type: boolean
Updated Name: Sarah | Type: string
Updated Age: 30 | Type: number
Updated Is Student: false | Type: boolean
Addition: 15
Subtraction: 5
Multiplication: 50
Division: 2.5
Remainder: 1
Hello, my name is Sarah and I am 30 years old.
```

#### Submission
Submit your `variablesAssignment.js` file for review.
